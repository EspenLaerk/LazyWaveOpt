Recommended Timeout: 34 s (label: 95th) - maximizes successful solutions per hour

Justification:

Timeout selection was based on maximizing the number of successful solutions per hour, given the batch processing logic. Analysis showed that most long evaluation times correspond to invalid or unphysical solutions, which are penalized in the fitness function and do not contribute to optimization. Therefore, a more aggressive timeout policy is justified. Several candidate timeouts were evaluated (95th, 99th percentiles, max, each with/without margin), and for each, the number of successful solutions, estimated wall-clock time, and solutions per hour were computed. The recommended timeout is the one that yields the highest rate of successful solutions per hour, balancing efficiency and solution quality. This approach is robust, data-driven, and academically justified for this application.
